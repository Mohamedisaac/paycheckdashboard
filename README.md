# Paycheck Cycle Dashboard
This dashboard app visually represents the paycheck-to-expenses cycle, where the needle moves like a financial gaugeâ€”never quite reaching the "dream" zone.

### **Paycheck Cycle Dashboard** ðŸ’¸ðŸ”„  
The **Paycheck Cycle Dashboard** is a creative, animated representation of the financial struggle many faceâ€”where income comes in, expenses go out, and dreams remain just out of reach.  

#### **Features:**  
ðŸ“‰ **Endless Loop Animation** â€“ The needle rises with income but always drops back due to bills, rent, and daily expenses.  
ðŸ’° **Expense Breakdown** â€“ Labels show paycheck deductions (Utilites, food, rent, Savings, etc.), leaving little for savings or building a house.  
ðŸ˜… **Relatable Theme** â€“ A playful but insightful take on financial reality.  
ðŸŽ¨ **Customizable UI** â€“ Modify angles, speed, and labels to match different financial situations.  

This app could be a **fun but thought-provoking** way to highlight the paycheck cycle.
